4th Lab assignment for Modern Programming

Goal is to create a program in java that will assist with developing basic math skills. 
Needs to be three levels of complexity, use the operators + - % and *, and track performance percentage.
Needs to log both user input and console output to a txt file.

Initial concept, one class for generating equations, one for evaluating, and a driver class.

4/22 Updated readability, variable naming and slightly altered some minor function calls.
Program works as expected, is almost ready for submission.

Allowed a total of four classes, ponder on how to reduce complexity by containing program functions to another class.

Consider doing this for the output handling functions toConsole, toConsoleAndLog, outputHeader, openOutputFile and closeOutputFile.
